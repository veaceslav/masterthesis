\section{General}
For our implementation of smartwatch sensors and bluetooth beacon sensors we used standard Android API to send scan and receive information.
There are other ways of communicating with the smartwatch, for example using Beetle\cite{beetle_mobisys16} service to communicate with smartwatch.
Using Beetle it is also possible to retrieve data from heart rate monitor in real time, in a similar way of how our SWAN service on the watch works.

The implementation on the SWAN service on the smartwatch does not have notable differences compared to a regular android phone application.
An extensive description of the operating system on the watch is described in Understanding Characteristics of Android Wear\cite{android_wear_char}.
In comparison with our power consumption experiment, the paper's experiment was performed  with power monitors attached 
directly to hardware, which gives higher accuracy.

\section{Swan Plus}
SWAN Plus project, which aims to offer expression evaluation on nearby devices, is closely related to our work on adding support for smartwatches and Bluetooth devices.
Our implementation of sending SWAN expressions on the watch was coded on top of already existing mechanism of sending expressions to nearby devices and forwarding results back to the expression
registrar. On the other hand, SWAN Plus focuses on multiple devices and uses a more close-to-metal approach of scanning and discovering the Bluetooth devices.
